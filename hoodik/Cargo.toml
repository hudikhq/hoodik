# Variant of the Debian packaging configuration that:
#   a) statically links with OpenSSL when building a Debian package because the
#      newest OpenSSL available on Ubuntu 16.04 at the time of writing is 1.0.2g
#      (see: https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/openssl) while Krill requires
#      OpenSSL >= 1.1.0.
#   b) uses a simpler systemd service unit file because Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't
#      support newer features supported by Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.
