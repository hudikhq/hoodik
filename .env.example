# Application port where it will listen to incoming connections (default: 4554)
# HTTP_PORT=5443

# Application address where it will listen to incoming connections
# 
# In Docker image this will be automatically set to 0.0.0.0

# secret that will be used to sign the JWT tokens
# if you don't set this it will generate a random secret every time

# If the backend is working by using cookies and not JWT this will be used as the cookie domain.
# it automatically defaults to be the same as the APP_URL

# This is completely optional attribute, if you don't set it up, the default will be used
# SESSION_COOKIE=hoodik_session

# This is completely optional attribute, if you don't set it up, the default will be used

# This option is turned on by default and it hides your cookie from the javascript frontend
# you can change this if you want to access the cookie from the frontend
# COOKIE_HTTP_ONLY=true

# This option defaults to true so that means your domain you are accessing the application
# from defined in your reverse proxy must be secure (https) otherwise the cookie won't be sent
# COOKIE_SECURE=true

# This option is turned on by default and it prevents the cookie from being sent to other
# domains than the one you are accessing the application from
#COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Lax

# this is the URL of the application.
# When you are running in production this should be the URL
# to your application.
#
# default: https://{HTTP_ADDRESS}:{HTTP_PORT}
APP_URL=https://localhost:5443

# APP_CLIENT_URL this is the URL of the client application.
# This is mostly used while developing and in production this should
# ideally be the same as the APP_URL to get the provided 
# web client interface.
#
# This will also be used for any kind of calls to actions, like links
# from emails will be pointing to this URL with the proper path.
#
# The provided address below is the default address of the web client while developing
#
# default: APP_URL
APP_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Location of the ssl cert file, this will be loaded and setup on to the server
# if you don't provide this, the server will generate a self signed certificate
# and place them in the /tmp directory. This is not recommended for production.
#
# default: DATA_DIR/hoodik.crt.pem
# SSL_CERT_FILE=

# Location of the ssl key file, this will be loaded and setup on to the server
# if you don't provide this, the server will generate a self signed certificate
# and place them in the /tmp directory. This is not recommended for production.
#
# default: DATA_DIR/hoodik.key.pem
# SSL_KEY_FILE=

# Email configurations it can be either SMTP or None.
# By default, the None is used which means no emails are being sent by the app,
# and user accounts are automatically verified once they register. This 
# is okay for local or development environments, but it is highly recommended
# to use SMTP in production. It will prevent users from activating with bogus emails
# and it will enable sending emails to users when files have been shared with them.
#
# To use SMTP you need to set the following environment variables:
# MAILER_TYPE=smtp
# SMTP_ADDRESS=smtp.gmail.com
# SMTP_USERNAME="username@gmail.com"
# SMTP_PASSWORD="generated-app-password"
# SMTP_PORT=465 # Optional, default: 465
# SMTP_DEFAULT_FROM="Full Name <username@gmail.com>"
